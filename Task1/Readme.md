# File Operations in Java

## Overview

This Java program demonstrates essential file operations including reading, writing, and modifying text files. It provides a practical implementation of file handling concepts with robust error handling and an interactive console interface.

## Key Methods

- `readFile(filePath)` : Reads and displays text file contents
- `writeFile(filePath, content)` : Creates/overwrites files with specified content
- `modifyFile(filePath, oldString, newString)` : Replaces text in existing files
- `main()` : Interactive demonstration of all operations

## How to Use

1. Compile: `javac Main.java`
2. Run: `java Main`
3. Follow prompts to test operations:
   - Initial file `demo.txt` is automatically created
   - Enter text to replace when prompted
   - View results in console and file
